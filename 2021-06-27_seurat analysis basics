Questions 6/27/21:
- How to access raw count matrix?
- What code to use for "top 100" cells? (Also what does the top 100 cells mean?
- How to make a DotPlot that doesn't group by cluster identity?
- How to assess average gene expression across all sample? (For comparing with bulk RNAseq, for example?)
